This project involves teaching a computer to interprit movie reviews and distinguish them as positive or negative. The data consists of reviews and subsequent labels for each review noting them as objectivly positive or objectivly negative. The review data is vectorized and transformed onto a numerical scale and the data is split for testing and training. As for further experimentation and evaluation, a sample of reviews are used to experiment with phrasing while precision and recall are used to further check the validity.
